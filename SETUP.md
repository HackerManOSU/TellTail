## 7. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

| Issue                              | Solution                                                    |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Build Fails in Vercel**         | Ensure `npm run test` passes locally before pushing.         |
| **ONNX Runtime Errors**           | Refresh and re-upload the image.                             |
| **Prediction Stability Issues**   | Try using a different browser (Chrome recommended).          |
| **Mobile Navbar Clipping**        | Resize the screen or switch to desktop view.                 |
| **Dependency Installation Fails** | Check that `Node.js`, `Python`, and `pip` are installed and up to date. |
