## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### 1. Goals from Last Week

#### Raed:
- Improve cat breed classifier accuracy and enhance cat age classification data collection.

#### Troy:
- Switch backbones for dog model and retrain to achieve accuracy over 90%.

#### Christian:
- Continue refining AI codebase and fix minor UI bugs.

#### Stephen:
- Add more detail and information to the home page.

#### Nathaniel:
- Finish About Us page and test site functionality.

#### Sam:
- Implement model selection buttons and finalize UI design.

#### Zane:
- Develop dog profiles and add PDF export functionality.

### 2. Progress and Issues

#### Raed:
- **What I did:** Read machine learning papers that aim to solve the same problem as our application. I also began data scraping using the Bing API for cat life stages.
- **What worked well:** Configuring the Bing API was notably easy due to free student credits with Microsoft Azure. This made Bing API more accessible since API requests can build up large costs.  
- **What I learned:** I learned how to navigate and configure Microsoft Azure for data scraping.
- **Challenges:** Data scraping is time-consuming as I have to verify each image to ensure that the data I am using is reliable.

#### Troy:
- **What I did:** Connected Dog Breed ONNX model to frontend. Created Dog Profiles. Stuck with ResNet50 due to inaccuracies by EfficientNetV2.
- **What worked well:** Integration of model, profiles, and API calls.
- **What I learned:** File separation and React coding. 
- **Challenges:** Connecting the breed classification with the dog profiles.

#### Christian:
- **What I did:** Added new upload hub pages that splits into two different pages (cats and dogs).
- **What worked well:** Dedicating specific time every day to work on the project and iterative testing.
- **What I learned:** I learned more about React and Tailwind scripting.
- **Challenges:** Learning more about Tailwind and React is still farily difficult and hard but I'm getting the ropes better.

#### Stephen:
- **What I did:** Worked on finalizing the design of the home page.
- **What worked well:** Getting everything to work and look how I wanted.
- **What I learned:** I learned more about using React and creating effects with it.
- **Challenges:** Working with React and Tailwind.

#### Nathaniel:
- **What I did:** Finished the About Us page layout and design, just waiting on images and info from some members. Tested some of the website's functionality.
- **What worked well:** UI and testing both went pretty well.
- **What I learned:** I learned a bit more about Tailwind CSS.
- **Challenges:** Some test results were not super accurate.

#### Sam:
- **What I did:** Implemented some UI designs into the website while also finishing the actual UI wireframe.
- **What worked well:** Changing colors, adding borders, and moving elements around the screen went well.
- **What I learned:** I learned more about TypeScript.
- **Challenges:** Getting the UI to mesh with what we currently have on the screen was tricky.

#### Zane:
- **What I did:** 
- **What worked well:** 
- **What I learned:** 
- **Challenges:** 

### 3. Plans and Goals for Next Week

#### Raed:
- Deploy a life stages model and redeploy a cat breed model with higher accuracy.

#### Troy:
- Implement dog life stage model into the frontend. Update Dog PDF/Profile to have age bracket.

#### Christian:
- Improve AI integration and refine UI components.

#### Stephen:
- Finish up the home page and test features.

#### Nathaniel:
- Work on the instructions page, adding tips on photo-taking for better results. Also, look into creating more tests.

#### Sam:
- Finish making the UI look like the wireframe. Ensure all UI changes work smoothly with the frontend.

#### Zane:
-
